# EMF Off
Arduino-based baby wireless monitor

The aim of this project is to create a baby monitor that will alert parents/guardian if the child makes noise, while reducing radio emissions to an absolute minimum.

The reason for doing this is that the project's owner believes that the EMF that we are exposed to in massive amounts from everyday wireless communication technologies such as WiFi, mobile/cell phones etc. is very harmful to our health.  This project does not aim to persuade others to accept this belief.  If you think that the EM radiation that we are continually bathed in does us no harm, feel free to add to it and buy a WiFi baby monitor.

Clearly, the best way to monitor your child while he or she sleeps is with your ears.  If this isn't possible or practical, the EMF Off baby monitor is here to help.  It offers the undeniable convenience of wireless communication, while keeping your child's exposure to a minimum.

While this project may seem like an contradiction, because on the one hand it states that wireless technology is bad for us, while on the other hand using that very same technology, I like to think of it as a compromise, the potential risks of which can be explained using this analogy:

You wouldn't want your child to smoke due to the well-documented damage this would do to their healty.  However, if you're walking down the street and someone blows out a cloud of smoke that your child walks through, it's probably not going to do them much harm!
